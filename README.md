Notebooks for lectures

- `working_with_data.ipynb`: Lecture on working with data, includes looking at data, removing outliers and null,
one-hot encoding, and TF-IDF
- `linear_regression.ipynb`: Lecture on linear regression from scratch, includes MSE as a loss function, gradient 
descent for two parameters, and supporting functions.
- `mlp.ipynb`: Lecture on our first full neural network (MLP) with PyTorch, includes using a diabetes dataset, binary 
cross-entropy for loss, and Adam for an optimizer. Since it's basic, using only 3 fully-connected layers, it's accuracy
is at 80%.
- `nlp.ipynb`: Lecture on NLP and working on basic tasks with models, includes tokenization, stop-word filtering, and 
sentiment analysis
- `lstm.ipynb`: Lecture on LSTMs and our first performant model, includes predicting an air passengers dataset and
creating a dataset with windows.
